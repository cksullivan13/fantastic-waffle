Various games and other side projects


Tic Tac Toe was made from following along with a video and was my very project after completing C# basics on codecademy.com. Uses WPF to allow two players to play more games of tic tac toe than they could ever dream of.


JS_HTML currently contains a virtual table tennis game modeled after Atari's pong that was made by following a series of videos. The pong game uses JavaScript and HTML5 to allow two people to compete against each other by using keyboard events as input.
